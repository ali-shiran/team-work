        <p>
          In futurism and science fiction, the metaverse is a hypothetical
          iteration of the Internet as a single, universal and immersive virtual
          world that is facilitated by the use of virtual reality (VR) and
          augmented reality (AR) headsets. In colloquial use, a metaverse is a
          network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          The term "metaverse" originated in the 1992 science fiction novel Snow
          Crash, as a portmanteau of "meta" and "universe". Metaverse
          development is often linked to advancing virtual reality technology
          due to increasing demands for immersion. Recent interest in metaverse
          development is influenced by Web3, a concept for a decentralized
          iteration of the internet. Web3 and The Metaverse have been used as
          buzzwords to exaggerate development progress of various related
          technologies and projects for public relations purposes. Information
          privacy, user addiction, and user safety are concerns within the
          metaverse, stemming from challenges facing the social media and video
          game industries as a whole.

      <!-- implementation -->
      <section>
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          In 2019, the social network company Facebook launched a social VR
          world called Facebook Horizon. In 2021, Facebook was renamed "Meta
          Platforms" and its chairman Mark Zuckerberg declared a company
          commitment to developing a metaverse. Many of the virtual reality
          technologies advertised by Meta Platforms remain to be developed.
          Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen criticised the move, adding that
          Meta Platforms' continued focus on growth-oriented projects is largely
          done to the detriment of ensuring safety on their platforms. Meta
          Platforms has also faced user safety criticism regarding Horizon
          Worlds due to sexual harassment occurring on the platform. In 2021,
          Meta made a loss of over $10 billion on its metaverse development
          department, with Mark Zuckerberg saying he expected operating losses
          to "increase meaningfully" in 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2017, Microsoft acquired the VR company AltspaceVR, and has since
          implemented virtual avatars and meetings held in virtual reality into
          Microsoft Teams.
        </p>
        <p>Proposed applications for metaverse technology include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>improving work productivity</li>
          <li>interactive learning environments</li>
          <li>e-commerce</li>
          <li>real estate and fashion</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <br />
      <!-- technology -->
      <section>
        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <h3>Hardware</h3>
        <p>
          Access points for the metaverse includes general-purpose computers and
          smartphones, augmented reality, mixed reality, and virtual reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dependence on VR technology has limited metaverse development and
          wide-scale adoption. Limitations of portable hardware and the need to
          balance cost and design have caused a lack of high-quality graphics
          and mobility. Lightweight wireless headsets have struggled to achieve
          retina display pixel density needed for visual immersion. Another
          issue for wide-scale adoption of the technology is cost, with consumer
          VR headsets ranging in price from $300 to $3500 as of 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          Current hardware development is focused on overcoming limitations of
          VR headsets, sensors, and increasing immersion with haptic technology.
        </p>
        <h3>Software</h3>
        <p>
          There has been no wide-scale adoption of a standardized technical
          specification for metaverse implementations, and existing
          implementations rely primarily on proprietary technology.
          Interoperability is a major concern in metaverse development, stemming
          from concerns about transparency and privacy. There have been several
          virtual environment standardization projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Universal Scene Description is a specification for 3D computer
          graphics interchange created by Pixar and supported by Blender,
          Apple's Scenekit and Autodesk 3ds Max. The technology company NVIDIA
          announced in 2021 they would adopt USD for their metaverse development
          tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          OpenXR is an open standard for access to virtual and augmented reality
          devices and experiences. It has been adopted by Microsoft for HoloLens
          2, Meta Platforms for the Oculus Quest, HTC for the HTC Vive, and
          Valve for SteamVR.

      <!-- criticism and concerns -->
      <section>
        <h2>Criticism and concerns</h2>
        <h3>Feasibility</h3>
        <p>
          In a February 2022 article for The New York Times, Lauren Jackson
          argued that the metaverse is "stalled from achieving scale by a lack
          of infrastructure for both hardware and software, a monopolistic
          approach to platform development, and a lack of clear governance
          standards."
        </p>
        <p>
          In December 2021 Raja Koduri senior vice president of Intel said that
          "Truly persistent and immersive computing, at scale and accessible by
          billions of humans in real time, will require even more: a 1,000-times
          increase in computational efficiency from today’s state of the art."
        </p>
        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          Information privacy is an area of concern for the metaverse because
          related companies will likely collect users' personal information
          through interactions and biometric data from wearable virtual and
          augmented reality devices. Meta Platforms (previously Facebook) is
          planning on employing targeted advertising within their metaverse,
          raising further worries related to the spread of misinformation and
          loss of personal privacy. In 2021, David Reid of Liverpool Hope
          University argued the amount of data collection in the metaverse would
          be greater than that on the internet stating "If you think about the
          amount of data a company could collect on the World Wide Web right
          now, compared to what it could collect with the metaverse, there is
          just no comparison."
        </p>
        <h3>User safety</h3>
        <p>
          User addiction and problematic social media use is another concern.
          Internet addiction disorder, social media, and video game addiction
          can have mental and physical repercussions over a prolonged period of
          time, such as depression, anxiety, and various other harms related to
          having a sedentary lifestyle such as an increased risk for obesity and
          cardiovascular disease. Experts are also concerned that the metaverse
          could be used as an 'escape' from reality in a similar fashion to
          existing internet technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Virtual crime like sex abuse and other user safety issues such as
          harassment are significant challenges with current social virtual
          reality platforms, and may be similarly prevalent in a metaverse. The
          potential presence of child predators on metaverse platforms is
          another concern, along with the potential for worsening child
          depression and loneliness. In February 2022, investigations by BBC
          News and The Washington Post found minors engaging in adult activities
          in applications such as VRChat and Horizon Worlds despite an age
          requirement of 13 years or older.
        </p>
        <h3>Social issues</h3>
        <p>
          Metaverse development may magnify the social impacts of online echo
          chambers and digitally alienating spaces or abuse common social media
          engagement strategies to manipulate users with biased content. In
          2022, Keza MacDonald of The Guardian criticized the utopianism of
          technology companies who claim that a metaverse could be a reprieve
          from worker exploitation, prejudice, and discrimination. MacDonald
          stated that they would be more positive towards metaverse development
          if it was not dominated by "companies and disaster capitalists trying
          to figure out a way to make more money as the real world's resources
          are dwindling." Marketing professor Andreas Kaplan, citing their
          experience studying Second Life users, argues that the metaverse may
          have a generally negative societal impact due to their strongly
          addictive potential.

        <h1>Metaverse Games</h1>
        <p>
          Components of metaverse technology have already been developed within
          online video games. The 2003 virtual world platform Second Life is
          often described as the first metaverse, as it incorporated many
          aspects of social media into a persistent three-dimensional world with
          the user represented as an avatar, however historical claims of
          metaverse development started soon after the term was coined.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early projects included Active Worlds and The Palace. Popular games
          described as part of the metaverse include Habbo Hotel, World of
          Warcraft, Minecraft, Fortnite, VRChat, and game creation platform
          Roblox which has since employed significant usage of the term in
          marketing. In a January 2022 interview with Wired, Second Life creator
          Philip Rosedale described metaverses as a three-dimensional Internet
          that is populated with live people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Social interaction and 3D virtual worlds are often an integral feature
          in many massively multiplayer online games.

        <h2>Key Pioneers and Movers in the Metaverse</h2>
        <p>
          Even before Mark Zuckerberg renamed Facebook to Meta in 2021, other
          companies have been at the forefront of metaverse development. Here
          are some of the leading pioneers and early movers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Epic Games</h3>
            <p>
              Epic Games is the creator of Fortnite, a multi-player shooting
              game released in 2017. It has evolved into a digital events place
              where users can attend dance parties and virtual music concerts.
              <br />
              Epic Games continues to provide end-to-end solutions for both
              developers and non-creatives to make, distribute, and operate
              games and other content. Its developers can move across brands and
              platforms, including Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, PC, iOS, and
              Android.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Microsoft</h3>
            <p>
              The leader in work-related software, Microsoft saw the bright
              prospects of metaverse early on with its 2014 acquisition of
              Minecraft, created by Stockholm-based Mojang in 2009. Players move
              in a Lego-like environment, where they "mine and craft" materials
              into tools they can use to build their own world and defend
              themselves against monsters. CEO Satya Nadella was vocal about the
              company's intention to stay ahead of the pack in the metaverse
              when he announced the 2022 takeover of Activision Blizzard, which
              is the creator of Call of Duty, Diablo, and Overwatch.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Roblox</h3>
            <p>
              Roblox, which initially released its game with the same name on PC
              in 2006 before becoming available on mobile and Xbox, hosts around
              50 million user-created games. The cute and colorful appearance of
              the mini-games it offers has made Roblox a big hit among kids.
              "Adopt Me," which simulates caring for pet animals, and
              "Brookhaven," a role-playing game where players can style their
              homes and vehicles, are some popular examples.
              <br />
              Developers can sell items (usually accessories for an avatar)
              while players can buy and resell them. Premium subscribers can
              convert the digital currency from this game (called Robux) into
              real money as long as they meet the age criteria (13 years old and
              up) and have earnings of at least 100,000 Robux in their account.
              <br />
              Players can join forums to meet new friends. They can also invite
              friends to play a game using Roblox's messaging system.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Nvidia</h3>
            <p>
              Nvidia, one of the industry leaders in graphics processing units
              that power gaming PCs, is also deep into the metaverse. It has
              been working for years toward the launch of OmniverseTM. With its
              beta version introduced in 2020, this simulation and collaboration
              platform can create tools with practical uses in the real world,
              such as 3D avatars with virtual assistant capabilities. Founder
              and CEO Jensen Huang said Omniverse will be available as an
              open-source tool to individual creators.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Niantic</h3>
            <p>
              Niantic is the software development company best known for making
              the 2016 augmented reality (AR) mobile game Pokemon Go. Unlike
              most metaverse advocates, however, founder and CEO John Hanke
              believes in bringing people closer to the real world than the
              other way around. The company conveyed this in its 2021 "Meet You
              Out There" campaign, emphasizing AR's capability to enhance
              real-world experiences. Weeks before the campaign, it released the
              Lightship AR developer kit.
              <br />
              Meanwhile, it expects to fully roll out its bitcoin-collection AR
              game called Fold, which will be available via app in 2020.

        <h2>What Do You Need to Play Metaverse Games?</h2>
        <p>To play the most basic games, you'll need the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>A reliable internet connection</h3>
            <p>The faster the speed of your internet package is, the better.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>A virtual reality headset</h3>
            <p>
              VR gadgets can run into thousands of dollars but you have
              options—from Google Cardboard (which makes use of your smartphone
              and a cardboard viewer) to headsets connected to a PC (Valve,
              Sony, HTC, and HP) or console and wireless units (Oculus Quest).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>PC or mobile device</h3>
            <p>
              If you won't be using a stand-alone headset, you'll need a PC or
              smartphone on which to connect your headset.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Blockchain wallet</h3>
            <p>
              You'll need a blockchain wallet if you'd like to play metaverse
              games that involve the use of cryptocurrencies or digital money.

          />
          <p>
            Vietnamese start-up Sky Mavis released Axie Infinity in 2018.
            Inspired by Pokemon, this game features fantasy creatures called
            Axies, which players can breed, raise, collect, and trade. Every
            creature has over 500 body parts you can customize. The offspring of
            Axies acquire new powers and characteristics, depending on their
            gene combination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Axies can hunt for treasure or battle against other Axies so you can
            earn rewards. You can buy land and homes for your Axies to live in,
            creating them according to the resources on the platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            The virtual pets and other items in this game have value in the form
            of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or digital certificates of ownership
            governed by blockchain technology. Players can also find scholars or
            people with whom they can lend three of their Axies so they can earn
            tokens. The game’s main currency is called Axie Infinity Shards or
            AXS. Meanwhile, players earn smooth love potion or SLP tokens for
            beating opponents and completing in-game quests. AXS and SLP tokens
            are necessary for breeding Axies.

            Argentinian duo Ari Meilich and Esteban Ordano opened Decentraland
            to the public in 2020. Using the MANA cryptocurrency, you can create
            avatars, buy wearables, and acquire real estate in this virtual
            space consisting of over 90,000 land parcels. As a landowner, you
            can rent out lots—each measuring 16 virtual square meters—or
            whatever is on it: houses, hotels, parks, cinemas, casinos, and what
            have you. You can also earn income by organizing a concert and
            selling tickets, setting up an exhibit to auction off digital art,
            and so on. MetaMask is among the popular digital wallets that
            players use for this platform.

            width="600"
          />
          <p>
            Sandbox was first launched in 2012 as a mobile game by Pixelowl
            co-founders Arthur Madrid and Sébastien Borget of France. It’s
            another user-generated platform where users, represented as
            block-like customizable avatars, become owners of what they create
            through blockchain and smart contracts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sandbox has three main products. VoxEdit is a 3D modeling tool where
            you can create avatars, vehicles, plants, animals, tools, and other
            objects. You can export your creations into Sandbox’s second
            product, the Marketplace, where you can sell your items. The final
            product is the Game Maker, where users can develop 3D games without
            using code.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main currency in the Sandbox is called Sand. You can acquire and
            trade land and estates (a collection of lands), which you can select
            from the Sandbox map. There’s also an option for you to offer these
            properties in the Open Sea NFT marketplace.

            width="600"
          />
          <p>
            The soon-to-be-released Illuvium is causing a lot of buzz in the
            gaming world, which describes it as a “true triple-A, 3D blockchain”
            game. In this game, you hunt for deity-like creatures called
            illuvials on this alien landscape, capture them using shards, or
            nurse them back to health. These creatures can then help you fight
            other players and monsters, which number over a hundred. Illuvials
            are also tradable NFTs—the stronger and rarer they are, the higher
            their value becomes. Once you have three of the same illuvial, you
            can fuse or merge them into one new creature—and raise their
            value—if each of them has reached its highest level through combat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Players unearth their armor and weapons from the Illuvium
            environment. You earn rewards in the form of Illuvium crypto or ILV
            after tournaments and quests and exchange your ILV on the IlluviDEX.

            assets via Ethereum. The official currency of its games is also
            called chromia (CHR). The following are its top games created by

            You also have other livelihood options like running an apiary or bee
            farm and later selling honey. My Neighbor Alice NFTs (which include
            plants, animals, houses, clothes, decor, and so on) are tradable on

            You get a shovel to start playing but to get more TLM and powerful
            mining tools, it’s best to buy your own land, or you can pay a
            landowner to start excavating. Battling other explorers and going on
            mining missions can also earn you tokens.

            In Farmers World, released in 2021, you can buy land to mine gold,
            grow crops, breed livestock, catch fish, and build homes for your
            farm animals. You can buy tools on the AtomicHub market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything on your virtual property and the goods that come out of
            it, including milk and eggs, are NFTs. The produce you harvest can
            be sold or traded to other players.
          </p>
          <p>
            You’ll have to protect your farm against other intruders (red and
            white tribes) as well as other players who can steal your resources,
            or fight off jungle monsters from your farm premises.

            The creators of the Prospectors describe it as a multi-player
            economic strategy game that takes you to the 19th-century Wild West.
            The object of the game is to acquire gold that you can convert into
            the official game currency, Prospectors Gold.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the start of the game, you get three workers whom you can deploy
            to work for you or others. For starters, your workers can build a
            mine for you and start mining. You can mine on free land, but you’ll
            have to rent land to build structures on it. Unpaid rent will result
            in land being blocked and your belongings on it being put up for
            auction.

        <h2>1-The Matrix series (1999-2021)</h2>

        <p>
          The Matrix metaverse Within the context of the series’ universe, the
          Matrix is a simulated reality created by sentient machines following a
          war with humanity. In this timeline, machines achieved self-awareness
          and attempted to reach an agreement with human governments for a
          peaceful co-existence—which the humans denied with extreme prejudice.
          In the ensuing war, the humans were unprepared for the might of the
          machines, and in their desperation, darkened the sky with nanites in
          order to deprive the machines from their primary source of energy—the
          sun. This, unsurprisingly, also had a devastating effect on the earth
          and resulted in a global famine and the rapid deterioration of
          biological life.

        />
        <p>
          Inception metaverse Within the world of Inception, the dream-sharing
          technology was developed as a military tool to allow soldiers to
          practice combat techniques without incurring any actual physical
          damage. The characters use this technology for equally nefarious
          purposes. While Cobb is known as a skilled “extractor” (someone who
          steals ideas from a target’s subconscious), the film follows his
          attempt at the reverse of that process: “inception,” to implant an
          idea into a target, which has never been attempted before.

        <h2>3-The Thirteenth Floor (1999)</h2>
        <img src="img/Thirteenth_floor.jpg" alt="img" />
        <p>
          The Thirteenth Floor metaverse Before his murder, Fuller’s company had
          recently developed an immersive VR system that simulates Los Angeles
          in 1937. Over the course of the murder investigation, Hall meets Jane
          Fuller (Gretchen Mol), Hannon’s daughter, who is actively working to
          shut down the simulation. It is eventually revealed that not only is
          1999 Los Angeles also a simulation, it is one of thousands—and it is
          the only one where its inhabitants created their own simulation

        <h2>4-eXistenZ (1999)</h2>
        <img src="img/EXISTENZ.jpg" alt="img" />
        <p>
          eXistenZ metaverse Allegra Gellar (Jennifer Jason Leigh) plays a game
          designer working to debut her latest virtual reality creation:
          eXistenZ. At the beginning of the film, Gellar is demonstrating the
          game for a test audience and is shot by a “Realist”—a member of a
          radical fringe group determined to stop the development of
          reality-altering technology. The film follows the exploits of various
          factions attempting to obtain the only copy of the game in existence.
          Fair warning, this film is definitely the strangest on the list.

        <h2>5-Total Recall (1990)</h2>
        <img src="img/Total-Recall-2012.jpg" alt="img" />
        <p>
          Total Recall metaverse From the moment the film begins, the audience
          is introduced to a recurring dream Quaid has about a mysterious woman
          on Mars. This serves as the impetus for his visit to Rekall and his
          selection of a Martian secret agent vacation program. The implantation
          procedure, however, goes awry and Quaid begins to believe that he is
          an actual secret agent. His life then begins to resemble an action
          thriller. Secret agents, espionage, subterfuge, mutants; all the
          hallmark signs of a great pulp science-fiction story. As the story
          progresses, Quaid’s true identity becomes more obscure. Is he living a
          dream? Or is the entire film a dream?

        <h2>6-Surrogates (2009)</h2>
        <img src="img/surrogates-movie-poster.jpg" alt="img" />
        <p>
          Surrogates metaverse In contrast to the aesthetic and idealized forms
          of android surrogates, human operators are generally seen as sluggish
          and fearful of the outside world—at least insofar that surrogates
          allow human operators to live ideal versions of their lives from a
          safe distance. What sets this particular “metaverse” apart from other
          entries in this list is that rather than using a headset or something
          similar to enter a virtual world, humans get an entire Android body
          replacement, which they use to view the real world rather than a
          virtual one. Nonetheless, the disconnect between what is real and what
          isn’t still stands.

        <p>
          Tron metaverse As Flynn attempts to hack ENCOM’s mainframe, its
          powerful artificial intelligence known as Master Control Program (MCP)
          engages an experimental laser to upload Flynn into a virtual reality
          space called the “Grid,” populated by sentient programs. These
          programs are differentiated by “Users” who are digitized versions of
          humans who have been transported into the Grid. Within the Grid, these
          sentient programs are ruled over by the MCP and are indoctrinated to
          reject the existence of Users. Those who resist are made to fight to
          the death in gladiatorial style public games.

        <h2>8-Source Code (2011)</h2>
        <img src="img/70526_8.jpg" alt="img" />
        <p>
          Source Code metaverse Captain Stevens, as part of an experimental
          government program, has his consciousness transported into another
          man’s body. Over a series of repeating eight-minute cycles, it becomes
          apparent that Stevens has been sent inside a simulation, known as
          “Source Code,” of the last moments on a commuter train headed for
          Chicago. At the end of each eight-minute cycle, the train explodes,
          killing all passengers on board. The simulation has been reconstructed
          from the memories of the victims on board, and this attack is
          suspected of being the beginning of something larger.

        <img src="img/j6onjO5ZRRYBBZKLSCismOSQONk.jpg" alt="img" />
        <p>
          Based on the 2011 novel of the same name, Ready Player One follows a
          competition held in the aftermath of the death of a virtual reality
          pioneer. Ready Player One metaverse In the near future, most of the
          world’s population engage in virtual reality entertainment via a
          metaverse known as OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory
          Immersive Simulation) to escape the dystopia of their daily lives.
          James Halliday, co-founder of OASIS, has recently passed away and
          posthumously issues a challenge to players worldwide to pass three
          challenges for the chance to win full control of his wealth and the
          OASIS metaverse.

        <p>
          Guy (Ryan Reynolds), a bank teller, discovers that he is a background
          character in an online multiplayer action-adventure game known as Free
          City. Free Guy metaverse Millie Rusk (Jodie Comer), a programmer for
          Soonami Studio (the developer behind Free City), is on a mission to
          obtain evidence that the company has stolen her source code for the
          game. During an encounter with Molotov Girl, Rusk’s in-game avatar,
          Guy begins to deviate from his programming. Shortly after, Guy obtains
          a pair of sunglasses left behind by a player and is able to view Free
          City’s user interface the same way a player would. With this new-found
          knowledge in tow, Guy joins Rusk’s quest to reclaim what is rightfully
          hers.

        <img src="img/Wreck-It-Ralph-2012.jpg" alt="img" />
        <p>
          Last, but not least, is Wreck-It Ralph—the only entry on this list
          geared towards kids! Ralph, a video-game villain, tires of his life as
          an antagonist and sets out to become a hero. Wreck-it Ralph metaverse
          Set in an arcade, Wreck It-Ralph follows a group of characters across
          various video games who convene at the end of each day when the arcade
          closes its doors. Away from the prying eyes of humans, characters will
          leave their respective games via a power strip and meet in Game
          Central Station to socialize. There, Ralph—the antagonist of a game
          called Fix-It Felix, Jr.—meets with a support group filled with
          villains from a variety of video game franchises to vent about his
          assigned role as a “bad guy.” Perhaps the most fascinating/fun aspect
          of the Wreck-It Ralph metaverse is that it is a shared space between
          different “worlds” overlapping with multiple games.

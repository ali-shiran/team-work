        <h1>The Metaverse and Crypto</h1>
        <p>
          The metaverse, cryptocurrency, Web3. Besides all three of these things
          being hot technology buzzwords, what do they have in common? For many
          tech developers and investors, the metaverse and crypto are
          intertwined and will become part of Web3 -- a decentralized internet
          controlled by individual users rather than by big companies.

        <h2>Blockchain and how it powers the metaverse and cryptocurrency</h2>
        <p>
          Let's start with a fundamental piece of technology that lies at the
          heart of both cryptocurrency and the metaverse: blockchain. Originally
          designed by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto and now used by other big
          cryptos such as Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH), blockchain is a public digital
          ledger that records transaction data. Transactions utilizing a
          blockchain network can be peer-to-peer and remove intermediaries (such
          as a bank or tech company) from user interactions. This can reduce
          cost and speed up the time for transactions to take place, among other
          things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Commerce on the internet is still taking place using a digital version
          of traditional fiat currencies. Blockchain and currencies based on it
          were developed as a digital-native means of transacting business in a
          digital world. Metaverses with their 3D virtual worlds and immersive
          services are also seen by some as utilizing blockchain technology as a
          way to create permission-less interactions between internet
          users.Let's start with a fundamental piece of technology that lies at

        <h2>Metaverse, crypto coins, and NFTs</h2>
        <p>
          With the potential for e-commerce and social interaction, this is
          where cryptocurrencies and applications built on a blockchain enter.
          Direct peer-to-peer interactions on the web hold the promise of
          instantaneous settlement of funds and near-zero fees. Item ownership
          can be guaranteed using an NFT (non-fungible token), which could take
          the form of a piece of art, a digital collectible item, or a digital
          version of a real-world purchase, such as a pair of Nike sneakers you
          could also wear in the metaverse.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, though, the metaverse is largely the realm of the video game
          industry and other imaginative start-ups. It's worth noting that
          turmoil in the crypto space during the first half of 2022 has also
          cast a shadow on the metaverse and its viability as a fully fledged
          digital economy. Nevertheless, here are four early-stage projects to
          watch that are bridging the gap between cryptocurrencies and the
          metaverse.

        <h3>The Sandbox</h3>
        <p>
          The Sandbox (CRYPTO:SAND) is a user-created digital world in which
          users can create and sell digital content within the game. SAND is the
          in-game token that acts as a currency and is built atop the Ethereum
          blockchain network. These tokens can be bought and sold on a number of
          cryptocurrency exchanges. SAND can be used to purchase virtual land,
          buildings, accessories, and other items as NFTs.

        <h3>Decentraland</h3>
        <p>
          Decentraland (CRYPTO:MANA) is another Ethereum network-based metaverse
          experience. Participants can use the native token MANA to purchase
          virtual land and develop it for games and other experiences, as well
          as for avatars and digital accessories. Decentraland is controlled by
          the Decentraland DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). Owners
          of MANA or virtual property in Decentraland can participate in the DAO
          and vote on initiatives and new development.

        <h3>Axie Infinity</h3>
        <p>
          Think of Axie Infinity (CRYPTO:AXS) as an Ethereum blockchain-based
          version of Nintendo's (OTC:NTDOY) Pokémon franchise. Players train
          fantasy monsters called Axies and compete against other teams. Axie
          Infinity is a "play-to-earn" game, meaning participating can earn the
          player AXS tokens. The tokens can be spent on new Axies (which trade
          as NFTs), training existing Axies to improve their traits, and the
          upcoming launch of virtual land within the Axie Infinity universe. The
          most expensive Axie ever was bought for the equivalent of $820,000 of
          Ethereum (at the then-market price).

        <h3>Crypto Baristas</h3>
        <p>
          Crypto Baristas is an NFT project that aims to bridge the gap between
          the physical and virtual worlds. Owners of a Crypto Barista NFT
          character get access to a metaverse where other coffee enthusiasts can
          meet. But this is more than just a place to grab a virtual coffee. The
          project is also being used to fund an actual café in New York City
          called Coffee Bros., which will partner with coffee farmers around the
          world (the first being an established farmer in Honduras). At this
          point, this is a very new project that has only just recently released
          a white paper on how its tokens will work, but it's an example of how
          metaverses can also have real-world applications.
